# LEAF Gang Website

# Summary:
## What is this website?
This website was created for the LEAF Gang Twitch & YouTube gaming group on the request of a friend of mine. 
The website consists of an About Us page, a page for joining the group, a members page, a merchandise page, and a sponsors page.

## How does it accomplish this? (Code Explanation)
The website consists of 7 pages, with the Merch page and Sponsors page being the more advanced of the pages. The merch page has 
3 column wide rows for merchanidse, and in the merchandise you can scroll for the description of the item and where to buy it, without making
the page larger than it needs to by making the container it's in scrollable and not restricted by its visible height. The Sponsors page uses
a slideshow to include all the sponsors alongside a description of them, should they have multiple sponsors.
